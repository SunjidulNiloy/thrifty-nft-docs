# How It Works in Real Life

import { Callout, Cards, Card } from 'nextra/components'

To achieve true privacy, every innovative Thrifty NFT carries two distinct sets of metadata.

## 🎭 The Dual-Metadata System

<Cards>
  <Card icon="👀" title="1. Public Metadata" href="#">
    **Visible to Everyone.** 
    *   Cover Art
    *   Title & Description
    *   Rarity Traits
    *   *Functions like the book cover in a bookstore.*
  </Card>
  <Card icon="🔐" title="2. Private Metadata" href="/privacy-dilemma">
    **Owner-Only Access.**
    *   Full High-Res Content
    *   Decryption Keys (IPFS)
    *   *Functions like the actual pages of the book.*
  </Card>

## 🎬 Real World Examples

### 📚 The Decentralized Publisher
Imagine you are an author.
*   **Old Way:** Sell on Amazon → Amazon takes 30-65% → Amazon owns the customer.
*   **Thrifty Way:** Mint "Book NFT".
    *   **Public:** Cool 3D cover art.
    *   **Private:** The PDF/EPUB file.
    *   **Result:** You sell directly to fans. Only buyers can read. You keep 95%+.

### 🎵 The Musician
Sell your album as a Private NFT.
*   **Feature:** **"Streaming Rights"**.
*   Buying the NFT grants access to the encrypted audio stream via our decentralized player.
*   Sell it later? The new owner gets the listening rights; you lose them.

  **Censorship Resistance:** Even if our marketplace goes down, you still own the private metadata on IPFS. Your content is unstoppable.
