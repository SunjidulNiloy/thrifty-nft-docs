<Steps>
### Connect & Verify
Connect your wallet to the Thrifty Dapp. You must sign a signature request to verify ownership of your address.

### Prepare Your Assets
Select the file you wish to encrypt.
*   **Supported Formats:** JPG, PNG, MP3, MP4, PDF, ZIP, TXT.
*   **Limit:** Files up to 100MB (for standard minting).

### Set Metadata
You will define two sets of data:
1.  **Public Preview:** Upload a cover image and description (visible to everyone on OpenSea/Thrifty).
2.  **Private Payload:** Upload the actual file. *This step triggers the local encryption process in your browser.*

### Agree & Mint
Review the <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a>. Confim that you have legal rights to the content.
*   Click **Mint**.
*   The system will upload the encrypted payload to IPFS and write the smart contract transaction.

### Distribution
Once minted, the NFT is yours. You can:
*   **List it for sale:** Set a price in ETH or $THRIFTY.
*   **Hold it:** Enjoy your private encrypted storage.
*   **Gift it:** Transfer it to a friend's wallet.
</Steps>

  **Important:** Once you sell or transfer the NFT, you transfer the **Right to Decrypt**. You will lose access to the private file, and the new owner will gain it.
