Thrifty Social is built to reward active participation and empower creators with enterprise-grade tools.

## 🎁 Community Rewards (Airdrops)

We believe the network belongs to those who build it. Thrifty features a native **Activity-Based Airdrop System**.

### How it Works
1.  **AI Quality Scoring:** Our AI evaluates posts for authenticity and engagement. Value creators earn high scores; spammers get zero.
2.  **Weekly Epochs:** Scores are converted into $THRIFTY rewards every week.
3.  **Tiered Multipliers:** consistently high-ranking users get reward boosts.
