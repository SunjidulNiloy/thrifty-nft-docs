## 🛒 OpenSea vs. Amazon

What differentiates a **Digital Collectible** from a **Digital Product**?

| Platform | Product Type | Privacy | Monetization Model |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **OpenSea** | 🖼️ JPEGs, Art | ❌ **Public** (Everyone sees it) | Speculation / Trading |
| **Amazon** | 📚 E-books, Movies | ✅ **Private** (Only buyer sees it) | Consumption / Utility |

<Callout type="error" emoji="🛑">
  **The Dilemma:** If you sell an E-book as a conventional NFT, everyone can read it on the blockchain for free. You cannot monetize content that is public by default.

## 📉 The Bottle Neck

Absence of private metadata is the single biggest barrier preventing mass adoption of NFTs for:
*   Subscription Services (Netflix-style)
*   Digital Publishing (Kindle-style)
*   Premium Media (Spotify-style)

## 🔓 The Solution: Thrifty Private Metadata

We introduce a decentralized yet fully private metadata standard. This unlocks game-changing utility on public blockchains.
