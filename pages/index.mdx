## 🔐 The Twin-Metadata Standard

Every Thrifty NFT carries two distinct layers of data, revolutionizing how we define ownership.

<Cards>
  <Card icon="🌐" title="Public Metadata" href="/public-vs-private">
    **Visible to Everyone.** <br/> Includes the cover art, title, and public description. Acts as the "packaging" for your digital asset.
  </Card>
 <Card icon="🔒" title="Private Metadata" href="/privacy-dilemma">
    **Owner-Only Access.** <br/> Encrypted content (E-books, Music, 4K Video) stored on IPFS. Uses military-grade encryption access control.

## ⚡ Use Cases

Private metadata transforms NFTs from static JPEGs into functional digital products.

*   **📚 E-Books & Publishing:** Sell your book as an NFT. Only the buyer can decrypt and read it.
*   **🎵 Music & Media:** Distribute albums or movies directly to fans without a middleman streaming service.
*   **💼 Professional Assets:** Sell templates, software code, contracting agreements, or consulting tickets.
*   **🎁 Gift Cards:** Send value securely to a social identity without knowing their wallet address.

## 🏗 System Architecture

Creating a private NFT involves a sophisticated multi-step encryption process that ensures zero-knowledge privacy while maintaining on-chain verification.
